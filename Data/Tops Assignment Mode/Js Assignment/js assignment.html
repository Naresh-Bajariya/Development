                    <p>
                        Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used
                        as a
                        part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and
                        make
                        dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

                        The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value which is used to represent a value which

                    <p>
                        The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's
                        end,
                        making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end,
                        making it easy to manage content from this end too. ViewState: It is maintained at only one
                        level
                        that is page-level.

                    •  Can be persisted in a Database, useful for Web Farms / Web Gardens.
                    •  Is Cleared when the session dies - usually after 20min of inactivity.
