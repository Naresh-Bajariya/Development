        <p class="lembo-history">
            Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of
            producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari.
            The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for
            the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.
        </p>
        <p class="lembo-history">
            Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide
            financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and
            René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of
            brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by
            1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was
            expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.
        </p>
        <p class="lembo-history">
            The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the
            Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group
            Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold
            Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New
            products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an
            increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis
            and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.
